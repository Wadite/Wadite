- 👋 Hi, my name is Roee Kishon.
- 👀 I’m interested in Bioninformatics and Computational Biology. I'm motivated as hell to begin working in these fields and gain knowledge.
  I love helping others as well as manipulating data!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving on Python (Pandas & Matplotlib), MySQL and Tableau.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Biology related programming / Data Science.
